# Simple Meteor Signup

A simple signup form with LOTS of comments

Geared as an overview of Meteor/Web Application basics for COMPLETE BEGINNERS

All that's expected is a basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript

To get started, I recommend reading **main.js**

Note: This doesn't do anything with actual autentication. It's mostly just a simple demo of how to use a form to add to a collection. It does't actually send out emails, just collects them in a list.
